# gitdemo
A repo to be used demoing various git &amp; GitHub features in the **_Chingu Roundtables_**.

This uses a simple Celcius to Fahrenheit conversion to demon-strate how to effectively work in a team with **_git_** and **_GitHub_**. This is simple by design since we what to show how to use git and GitHub rather than producing a true app.

Here's a simple example of how to create a graph in a Markdown file

```mermaid
  graph TD;
      Lalala-->Bebebebe;
      OOOoo-->Zzzzz;
      B-->D;
      C-->D;
```
