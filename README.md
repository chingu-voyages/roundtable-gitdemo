# gitdemo
A repo to be used demoing various git &amp; GitHub features in the **_Chingu Roundtables_**.

This uses a simple Celcius to Fahrenheit conversion to demon-strate how to effectively work in a team with **_git_** and **_GitHub_**.

Here's a simple example of how to create a graph in a Markdown file

```mermaid
  graph TD;
      Lalala-->Bebebebe;
      OOOoo-->Zzzzz;
      B-->D;
      C-->D;
```
Commit messages are important because they are so useful when resolving issues 
that may come up after the PR is merged.

You should never update files directly in GitHub. Doing this greatly increases the risk of a merge conflict!!!!!!!!!
